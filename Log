# My personal observations on AI agents like Chat GPT, iGPT, etc

1. Garbage In, Garbage Out: Like all computer programs, if you enter garbage as input, you will get garbage as output. Make your prompts more specific to get useful response. THe 
2. Do not outsource your critical reasoning to an AI agent. There is no actual intelligence to the current models. 
3. Pretty good for speeding up repetitive, non-value added tasks which cannot be eliminated.
